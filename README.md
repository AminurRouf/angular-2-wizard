"An example multi step form which submits data to .net web api" 
# Notes

* Good docs https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/
* Forms and validation are baked right into the framework :thumbsup:
* 2 way binding can be used along side the container/presentation pattern :thumbsup:
* Took a while to figure out how to pass data and events between components
* Some wacky syntax going on in the templates but I'm sure you'd soon get used to it
* Page hot reload time is slow (6ish seconds on my machine), not terrible but needs to be closer to 1 second
* Feels very 'enterprisy' much more OOP
* Typescript :expressionmore:
