"An example multi step form using Angualr 2 which submits data to .net core web api" 

# Why Angualr 2

* Good docs https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/
* Forms and validation are baked right into the framework :thumbsup:
* 2 way binding can be used along side the container/presentation pattern :thumbsup:
* Custom Validation
* Found Dependency Injection to be useful
* Page hot reload time is slow (6ish seconds on my machine), not terrible but needs to be closer to 1 second
* Feels very 'enterprisy' much more OOP
* Typescript :smile:
